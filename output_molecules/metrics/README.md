# Metrics

Contains the metrics computed for the final molecules created by the model.

Specifically will contain the following files:
- `molecule_chef_metrics.pt` : Contains the tabulated metrics created by the `evaluate_metrics.py` script of Molecule Chef
    - Contains the following metrics for each molecule:
        - Validity
        - Uniqueness
        - Novelty 
        - FCD 
        - Quality Filters
- `qed_values.pt` : Contains the sorted QED values associated with each product molecule
- `hiv_replication_inhibition_probability.pt` : Contains the sorted HIV replication inhibition probability generated by the model for each product molecule
